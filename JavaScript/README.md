### Objects & Classes

#### Exercises

1. Create an object called `person` with properties `name`, `age`, and `occupation`. Log each property to the console.
2. Write a function that takes an object as an argument and returns the sum of all its numeric properties.
3. Create an object called `car` with properties `make`, `model`, and `year`. Add a method called `honk` that logs "Honk honk!" to the console.
4. Write a function that takes an object and a property name as arguments, and returns the value of that property.
5. Create an array of objects, where each object represents a book with properties `title`, `author`, and `pages`. Log the title of each book to the console.
6. Write a function that takes an array of objects and returns a new array with only the objects that have a certain property.
7. Create a class called `Dog` with properties `name`, `breed`, and `age`. Add a method called `bark` that logs "Woof!" to the console.
8. Write a function that takes a class and a property name as arguments, and returns the value of that property for a new instance of the class.
9. Create an object called `rectangle` with properties `width` and `height`. Add a method called `area` that returns the area of the rectangle.
10. Write a function that takes an object and returns a new object with the same properties, but with all property names converted to uppercase.

#### Mini-Games
1. *Guess the Property*: Create an object with several properties, and then write a function that takes a property name as an argument and returns the value of that property. Test the function by guessing different property names.
2. *Object Scavenger Hunt*: Create an object with several nested objects and arrays. Write a function that takes a property path as an argument (e.g. "person.address.street") and returns the value at that path.
3. *Classy Cars*: Create a class called `Car` with properties `make`, `model`, and `year`. Create several instances of the class and store them in an array. Write a function that takes the array as an argument and returns the average year of all the cars.
4. *Dog Show*: Create a class called `Dog` with properties `name`, `breed`, and `age`. Create several instances of the class and store them in an array. Write a function that takes the array as an argument and returns the oldest dog.
5. *Rectangle Rodeo*: Create an object called `rectangle` with properties `width` and `height`. Add a method called `area` that returns the area of the rectangle. Write a function that takes the rectangle object as an argument and returns a new rectangle object with the same area, but with different dimensions.

#### Challenges
1. *Deep Copy*: Write a function that takes an object as an argument and returns a deep copy of the object (i.e. a new object with the same properties and values, but with no shared references).
2. *Object Merge*: Write a function that takes two objects as arguments and returns a new object that combines the properties of both objects.
3. *Class Inheritance*: Create a class called `Animal` with properties `name` and `age`. Create a subclass called `Dog` that inherits from `Animal` and adds a property `breed`. Create an instance of the `Dog` class and log its properties to the console.
4. *Object Prototype*: Write a function that takes an object as an argument and returns its prototype chain (i.e. the sequence of objects that the original object inherits from).
5. *Class Composition*: Create a class called `University` with properties `name` and `departments`. Create a subclass called `Department` that has properties `name` and `courses`. Create an instance of the `University` class and add several departments to it. Log the university's departments and their courses to the console.

4. Guess the word
5. Timer
6. Calculator

10 exercises and 10 theory questions on closures:

Exercises
1. *Counter*: Create a function `createCounter` that returns a counter function. Each time the counter function is called, it increments and returns the current count.
2. *Private Variables*: Implement a `BankAccount` class using closures. The class should have private variables for `balance` and `accountNumber`, and public methods for `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `getBalance`.
3. *Data Hiding*: Create a function `createSecretMessage` that returns a function. The returned function takes a message as an argument and returns the message encrypted with a secret key. The secret key should be hidden from the outside scope.
4. *Callback Functions*: Implement a `setTimeout` function using closures. The function should take a callback function and a delay as arguments and execute the callback function after the specified delay.
5. *Function Factory*: Create a function `createAdder` that returns a function. The returned function takes a number as an argument and returns the sum of the number and a fixed value.
6. *Closure Chain*: Implement a function `createChain` that returns a function. The returned function takes a value as an argument and returns a new function that takes another value as an argument. The chain should continue until a terminal value is reached.
7. *Memoization*: Create a function `createMemoizer` that returns a function. The returned function takes a function as an argument and returns a memoized version of the function.
8. *Event Handler*: Implement a function `createEventHandler` that returns a function. The returned function takes an event type as an argument and returns a new function that handles the event.
9. *Generator*: Create a function `createGenerator` that returns a function. The returned function generates a sequence of numbers on each call.
10. *Logger*: Implement a function `createLogger` that returns a function. The returned function logs messages to the console with a prefix.

Theory Questions
1. What is a closure in JavaScript, and how is it created?
2. What is the difference between a closure and a regular function?
3. How do closures interact with the outer scope, and what are the implications?
4. Can you explain the concept of "data hiding" in the context of closures?
5. How do closures enable the creation of private variables and functions?
6. What is the relationship between closures and higher-order functions?
7. Can you describe a scenario where a closure would be useful for managing state?
8. How do closures differ from object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation?
9. Can you explain the concept of a "closure chain" and provide an example?
10. How do closures impact the performance and memory usage of a JavaScript application?
